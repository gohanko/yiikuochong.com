      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a dream of a lot of Malaysians to find work in Singapore - mostly due to the 3.5 exchange rate (as of 2025), and I was one of those people.
So equipped with 3 years of software development experience, and freshly out of university I went hunting for a job in Singapore for about 4 months. Here are my experience.
TLDR: As of March 2025, the Singaporean tech market is really hard to get into, even for locals.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering Hi-Hive Community</title>

      <description>During COVID-19, my university (UTAR) debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive Community. A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.
After using the application for a few years, I noticed that it was too bloated with unnecessary features, it&amp;rsquo;s not very responsive, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.
Thus, I have the idea of rebuilding the application using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and more modern UI frameworks.</description>
