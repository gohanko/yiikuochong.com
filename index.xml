      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brandon. I write code for a living. Sometimes for companies, sometimes for myself.
This is a personal blog which I use to document my learning journey and share my work with the world.

      <description>During COVID-19, my university (UTAR) debuted an attendance tracking called Hi-Hive Community. A lecturer would present a QR code, and the students will scan it to take attendance.
After using the application for a few years, I noticed that it was too bloated with unnecessary features, it&amp;rsquo;s not very responsive, and important items are buried in unending levels of menus.
Thus, I have the idea of rebuilding the application using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and more modern UI frameworks.</description>
