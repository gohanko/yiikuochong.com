It's a dream of a lot of Malaysians to find work in Singapore - mostly due to the 3.5 exchange rate (as of 2025), and I was one of those people.

So equipped with 3 years of software development experience, and freshly out of university I went hunting for a job in Singapore for about 4 months. Here are my experience.

**TLDR:** As of March 2025, the Singaporean tech market is really hard to get into, even for locals.

# Introduction to Myself
A bit of context about myself, I was a self taught software engineer who worked for about 3 years in the fintech industry before I decided to take a break from work in form of a university degree. That's only partially true, I also wanted a degree to work overseas. So it was a good opportunity to heal from my burnout and progress my career. I end up graduating with a degree in Information Systems Engineering from Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) in November 2024. This was when I started looking for a job.

# My Job Hunt Plan
So, the plan was to apply for jobs in Singapore while I was still in Malaysia. I was hoping to get a job offer before I moved there. Well, I can't exactly just move there without somekind of Visa or permit isn't it? And I don't exactly want to move to Johor and physically go job hunting in Singapore.

## Target Market
My main target was to get a job in Singapore, but I also wanted to keep my options open. So I decided to apply for jobs in Malaysia as well. I also applied to Findland, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia, mostly out of curiousity. This serves as a really good way to compare the job markets in these countries. It's an unintentional A/B test of sorts.

## Job Portals
There are many job portals on the net, but the most popular portals in these countries were JobStreet/Seek, and LinkedIn. Thus, the majority of the applications were done through these platforms.

# The Job Hunt Experience
Over a period of 4 months (starting November 2024), I applied to 292 jobs in total, with 170 of them in Singapore, 78 in Malaysia, 26 in New Zealand, 3 in Japan, 2 in Finland, and 2 in Australia. The other 11 were for remote global roles.

## November of Despair
The first month was a bit of a shock. Back when I was working in 2020, I was getting responses and interviews within a week or two of applying. But this time, I was getting only around 15 responses for the 58 applications I sent out.

Out of the 15 responses, I got 3 interviews. One was with CoinGecko, but they decided to stop hiring for the time being, another was with an agency but they specialized in gambling products for clients, and with the last company, I finished all 4 rounds of interviews for a Senior Frontend Engineer role, but they said that my last payslips were too old, and they cannot justify the salary, which essentially means I can get the role but at a junior's salary.

All 15 responses were from Malaysia, and 0 at all from Singapore. I was starting to feel like I was doing something wrong, my resume weren't good enough, and my skills weren't as good as I thought. Lots of self-doubt, anxieties, and imposter syndrome.

I mentioned the situation to a few friends, and they told me that it's possible that it's because of the time of year. December is a slow month for hiring as it was the end of the financial year, and holiday season.

So I decided to wait until January to see if things would pick up.

## December of Waiting
Due to the reason above, I spent the month of December waiting for responses, and decided to work on my resume and LinkedIn profile. With the help for a few friends, some group chat members, and recruiters, I was able to create a better resume.

## January of Rejections
January came, and I started applying again. This time I applied to 58 jobs with majority of them in Singapore, and some in Malaysia, as well as a handful in New Zealand.

On the Singapore side, I got 2 responses, 1 from a recruiting firm, and another with a construction company. The role from the recruiting firm was not a good fit as they required a fluent Mandarin speaker, but I got a proper interview with the construction company, though I was not selected.

On the Malaysia side, I got 1 response from AEON Bank. I went through their interviews, and completed their coding test, but in the end they decided that I was not a good fit for the role.

Surprisingly, I was able to get 1 responses from New Zealand with a company called SiteHost. For this company, I did their coding test, and got an interview with them, but they decided to not select me for the next round because they could hire someone local.

This month is pretty much the same as the month before, except with a variety of companies in different countries. It is what it is, we need to just keep going.

The imposter syndrome did got stronger though.

## February of Hope
In February, I really ramped up my job applications. This month alone, I applied to 180 jobs. Majority of my applications were ghosted, only 18 companies responded, and majority of them were automated rejection responses.

Somehow this month  felt worse. It like applying to a black hole. Probably because I was applying to a lot more companies. I managed to get interviews with 2 companies.

Even with the 2 interviews, tons of rejection and ghosting still felt bad. I decided to release my frustration and also increase my luck by writing [a LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gohanko_ive-been-applying-to-jobs-in-singapore-and-activity-7293873628108963840-A5cj?utm_source=share) about my job search. That post ended up getting 40k impressions. Which was really really surprising.

From what I understand, the post gain traction because it was relatable. The SWE market around the world is really bad at the time.

## March of Employment
In March, I continued applying but only to 8 companies because I was a bit burnt out from the doing take home tests, and tons of interviews with recruiters (not only companies but those freelance recruiters).

I also decided to focus on the interviews I had lined up. Very interestingly, my attempt at increasing luck worked. People from 2 other companies saw my post and reached out to me. 

Both were trusted team members of the companies who referred me to their managers, and I was able to get better quality interviews due to that.

In the end, I was able to get 2 offers from the pool of 4. One was from the people who saw my post, and the other was from a company I applied to in February. The other two ended up ghosting me, and decided I wasn't a good fit.

I decided to accept one of the offers, and now I'm employed! ðŸ¥³ It's a remote role as a web developer for a digital agency in Singapore.

The other offer was with a Singaporean cybersecurity firm with an office in KL. I was really tempted to take the offer but I decided to go with the remote role because of their remote option.

# Analysis and Dissection

## Job Market
In the first few months, I decided to do some research on the Singaporean job market.

## Ghosting and Reply Rates
Out of the 170 Singaporean companies that I've applied to, only 3 replied. That's a 0.0176% reply rate. Compared to 19 out of 78 Malaysian companies, which is a 24% reply rate. 

The Australian and New Zealand companies do well in this department since every one of my applications has a response, sometimes automated, a lot of times a human replied (as far as I can tell).

In someways, this points to the state of the job market in
